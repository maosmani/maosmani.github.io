when it came to do something the first thing that you think about it <br>
                                                                     <br>
how much time it will take to get the results that you want <br>
                                                          <br>
and how i will get it you do not know how to do it and what are the things <br>
<br>
that if you do it you will get the results that you want all of us like this <br>
<br>
when we do something new or learn new skill but what if we look for someone <br>
<br>
who did it before us he know the path enough so if we ask him how he did it <br>
<br>
we also will get it .
